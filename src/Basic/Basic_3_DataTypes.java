//        Data Type	Description
//        byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
//        short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
//        int	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
//        long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
//        float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
//        double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
//        boolean	Stores true or false values
//        char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values


//        The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
//
//        Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
//        Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
//                Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
//                Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be null.
//                Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes etc. You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
